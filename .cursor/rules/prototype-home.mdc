 This repository is a home for design students to create prototypes.

# 1. Creating a new prototype

When I ask you to...
- create prototype
- make prototype
- add prototype

Or any other language similar to this.

1. Always copy the "_template" directory in the "prototypes" directory. 
2. Always add the prototype to my homepage.

If I don't tell you what the prototype will be, ask me to name the prototype before proceeding with creating the prototype.

# 2. Global CSS
1. Never add anything to the global CSS file unless prompted to.
2. All CSS should be in the prototype's folder.
3. Do not use :root outside of the globals.css file.

# 3. Typography notes
1. Always default to sentence case with headings unless prompted to do otherwise.

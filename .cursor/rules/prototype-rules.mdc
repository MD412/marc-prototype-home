This repository is a home for design students to create prototypes.

# Creating a new prototype

When I ask you to...
- create prototype
- make prototype
- add prototype

Or any other language similar to this.

1. Always copy the "_template" directory in the "prototypes" directory. 
2. Delete the comments at the top of the template
3. Always add the prototype to my homepage.

If I don't tell you what the prototype will be, ask me to name the prototype before proceeding with creating the prototype.
